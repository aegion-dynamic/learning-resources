# Learning Pathway (Primary)

## A note to learners

> The best ML scientists are the ones who can ask the best questions

Machine Learning is an empirical science. What this means is that because there doesn't exist formal definitions / understanding of the mathematics behind the field, its impossible to impossible to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the field. As with any other empirical field, expertise and intuition can be developed by learning the various methods and continuously iterating through Hypothesis-Experiment cycles.&#x20;

As one learns the various techniques and continuously applies their knowledge towards solving problems, one learns how they can solve problems better and how can come up with the right questions. You can only learn this by working on **hard** projects that take over 3-4 months of Hypothesis-Experiment iterations in a cohort (where everyone is solving similarly **hard** problems).

## Pathway

The learning pathway we recommend has two tracks, and forces the learner to pursue these two tracks in parallel in addition to picking up practice projects.

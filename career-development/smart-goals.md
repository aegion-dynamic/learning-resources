# SMART Goals

Goal setting is one of the most difficult processes to create and adhere to, as humans we tend to want spontaneity. But that doesn't mean that the efforts we put are not going to be unfocused. Using the SMART goal method to design your learning activities will help you get the most out of the effort you put towards something.&#x20;

### SMART Goals Explained

The SMART goal method is a structured approach to setting and achieving goals, designed to provide clarity, focus, and motivation. By defining goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound, individuals can ensure their efforts are well-directed and productive.

1. **Specific**: Goals should be clear and specific. Vague goals can be difficult to achieve because they lack direction. Ask yourself:
   * What exactly do I want to accomplish?
   * Why is this goal important?
   * Who is involved?
   * Where is it located?
   * Which resources or limits are involved?
2. **Measurable**: It's essential to have criteria for measuring progress. This helps you stay on track, reach your target dates, and experience the exhilaration of achievement. Consider:
   * How much?
   * How many?
   * How will I know when it is accomplished?
3. **Achievable**: Goals should be realistic and attainable. While it's important to challenge yourself, setting unattainable goals can lead to frustration and demotivation. Reflect on:
   * How can I accomplish this goal?
   * How realistic is the goal based on other constraints, such as financial factors?
4. **Relevant**: Your goals should matter to you and align with other relevant goals. Ensuring a goal is relevant means that it is worthwhile and fits into the broader objectives of your life or career. Ask:
   * Does this seem worthwhile?
   * Is this the right time?
   * Does this match our other efforts/needs?
   * Am I the right person to reach this goal?
5. **Time-bound**: Every goal needs a target date, so you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals. Consider:
   * When?
   * What can I do six months from now?
   * What can I do six weeks from now?
   * What can I do today?
